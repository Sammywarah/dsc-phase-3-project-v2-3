# Customer Churn Prediction at SyriaTel

### Overview:
This project aims to build a classifier to predict whether a customer will soon stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. By identifying potential churners in advance, SyriaTel can take proactive measures to retain these customers, thereby reducing revenue loss and improving customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem:
SyriaTel is facing challenges with customer churn, where customers are discontinuing their services with the company. This has significant financial implications and affects the overall customer experience. The telecom business is interested in reducing revenue loss caused by customers who don't stick around very long. The key question is whether there are predictable patterns that indicate which customers are likely to churn.

## Data Understanding:
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to customer demographics, usage patterns, and account information. Features include customer state, account length, international plan status, number of customer service calls, and more. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether the customer churned.

## Modeling Approach:
The project employs classification modeling techniques to predict customer churn. Three models were explored: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. Each model was trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation:
The performance of each model was assessed based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Confusion matrices were also examined to understand the model's predictions in detail.

## Recommendations:
Based on the evaluation results, the Logistic Regression model demonstrated the best performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Therefore, it is recommended that SyriaTel utilize this model for predicting customer churn.

## Next Steps:
Further analysis can be conducted to identify additional features that may improve the model's predictive performance. Additionally, implementing strategies to retain customers identified as likely to churn can help SyriaTel reduce churn rate and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion:
By leveraging machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, SyriaTel can proactively address customer retention and mitigate revenue loss. This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and empowers SyriaTel to make informed decisions to improve business outcomes.
